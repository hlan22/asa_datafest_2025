1. [Motivation and Research Question](#motivation)
2. [Data Sourcing](#factors-that-may-affect-office-attendance)
3. [Analysis](#analysis)
4. [Future Directions](#future-directions)

## Motivation

- talk about Savills' challenge to us

- We needed to narrow down and select something to focus on

- We know with real estate it is important to know WHAT to buy
  - how large of an office?
  - what location? major markets?

- In order to optimize size of location, you need to know how many people will show up to the office

- However, modelling this after covid times can be complicated - we are here to do that

## Response: Office Occupancy

- Predicting who will show up to offices can be hard after covid

- What if you care about attendance at an office you choose? What if the market you choose to settle in affects who attends work?

- Using data from Kastle, we talk about the occupancy rate

## Major Markets

## Our Research Question 

<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.4em; font-weight: bold;">
What variables explain the increasing trend of post-COVID office occupancy across major markets?
</div>

## Analysis: Method

## Conclusions

extra yap: connecting to the main question.
What trends explain the trend what is making people return to office, and is it dependent on city

## Future Directions

<br>

1. We are very limited by data collection

<br>

2. Prediction for clients' future Occupancy

<br>

3. Increasing interpretability for clients
