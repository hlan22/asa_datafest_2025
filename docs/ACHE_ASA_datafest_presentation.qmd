## Outline
<br>
<br>

1. [Motivation and Research Question](#motivation)
2. [Data Sourcing](#factors-that-may-affect-office-attendance)
3. [Analysis and Results](#analysis-:-method)
4. [Future Directions](#future-directions)

## Motivation

<br> 

**The Challenge:** 

  * *"Inform Savills of notable trends or microtrends in the commercial real estate market that could be used to advise clients on where, when, whether and how to locate their offices."*


**Our Interest:** 

  * Understanding trends in why people show up to the office, so that clients can optimize their office size.

## 'Office Occupancy' As A Response

<br>

- Data is collected by **Kastle**

<br>

- Tells us proportion of people who attend the office **in comparison to March 1, 2020**

<br>

- We want to be able to understand the trend of occupancy, and eventually predict occupancy for the future

## Major Markets

![Major Markets Recorded by Kastle](../outputs/city_map.png){#fig-city-map fig-align="center"}

## Office Occupancy

## Office Occupancy: Deseasonalized

## Factors That Affect Office Attendance

<br>

1. Extreme Weather Events
2. Unemployment Rate
3. Traffic Congestion
4. Covid Cases
5. State Political Affiliation


## Example Factor: Political Affiliation

## Our Research Question 

<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.4em; font-weight: bold;">
What variables explain the increasing trend of post-COVID office occupancy across major markets?
</div>

## Analysis: Methods

<br>

- Bayesian Model

<br>

- Regularization of the predictors

<br>

- Hierarchical multivariate normal regression

## Analysis: Model


<br>

<div style="font-size: 0.55em;">
::: {.incremental}
* For major markets $j \in [1, 10]:$
$$
\begin{aligned}
\sigma^{(j)} &\sim \text{Exponential}(0.1) 
    && \text{Unexplained variation (noise) in this market} \\
\beta_0^{(j)} &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1) 
    && \text{Intercept (baseline occupancy for this market)} \\
\tau^{(j)} &\sim \mathcal{C}^{+}(0, 1) 
     && \text{How complex the model is "allowed to be" in this market} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

* For explanatory variables $i \in [1, 5]:$
$$
\begin{aligned}
\lambda_i^{(j)} &\sim \mathcal{C}^{+}(0, 1) 
     && \text{How much the variable "matters" in this market}\\
\beta_i^{(j)} &\sim \mathcal{N}\big(0, (\lambda_i^{(j)})^{2} \cdot (\tau^{(j)})^{2}\big) 
    && \text{Overall effect of the variable in this market} \\
\end{aligned}
$$
* Model: 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu_t^{(j)} &= \beta_0^{(j)} + \sum_{i=1}^5 \beta_i^{(j)} x_{i,t} 
    &&\text{Predicted occupancy at time } t \text{ for this market} \\
M_t^{(j)} &\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_t^{(j)}, \sigma^{(j)}) 
    && \text{Observed occupancy rate (data likelihood)}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Results: One Covariate for All Markets

## Results: All Covariates for One Market

## Model Verification

## Conclusions

* Different variables have **unique impacts on major markets**

* The model is **easily extendable** to add more covariates

* Our model gives useful results in two main ways:
  * **For Savills:** Better understand which properties to advertise to their clients
  * **For the Client:** Understand which market is best suited for them based on external factors

* We were surprised by the relationship with **traffic congestion**

## Future Directions

<br>

1. We were very limited by data collection

<br>

2. Want to do prediction for a client's future office occupancy

<br>

3. Increasing interpretability for clients
